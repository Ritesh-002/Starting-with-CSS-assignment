1. External CSS File
You can link an external CSS file to your HTML document using the <link> element inside the <head> section. This is the most common and recommended method for including CSS
2. Internal CSS
You can embed CSS directly within the <style> element in the <head> section of your HTML document. This method is useful for smaller stylesheets or when styles are specific to that particular HTML file.
3. Inline CSS
You can apply CSS directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. This method is generally discouraged for large-scale styling due to its lack of maintainability and separation of concerns.
4. @import Rule
You can use the @import rule within a <style> block or in an external stylesheet to import another CSS file into your current CSS file. Note that using @import within a <style> block has performance implications and is not recommended for production use.

Specificity in CSS determines which style rules are applied to an element when multiple rules could apply. It's like a hierarchy that decides which style is more important for an element.
